In this post you will make a NodeJS command line calculator and publish it to NPM all in just 10 minutes. So without any further ado lets start

## Step 1 - Setup

*       mkdir <insert project name>
        cd <insert project name>

*       npm init -y

    This command will create a package.json file this file will   contain all the details of our package

*   Create a file called cli.js in the root of our project this is the file in which we will write code

*       #!/usr/bin/env node

    This line will let our code know where to find NodeJS command

*       "bin": "cli.js"

    This line will let NPM know which file contains the code to execute when called

## Step 2 - Code

Open up the cli.js file and add the following code

    let args = process.argv.slice(2);
    console.log(eval(args[0]));

Now your cli.js file should look like this

    #!/usr/bin/env node
    let args = process.argv.slice(2);
    console.log(eval(args[0]));

Now let me explain the code line by line

1.  \#!/usr/bin/env node This line will let our code know where to find NodeJS command

2.  let args = process.argv.slice(2); this line will get the command line arguments given to the command line

3.  console.log(eval(args\[0])); Now this line will get the first argument and evaluate it and then print it out on the console.

## Step 3 - Testing it out locally

First run

    npm link

> This will simulate a global install
> Now open up your package.json and see the "name" value and run like this

    (Your package name in the package.json) 1+1

Now after testing it out run

    npm unlink

## Step 4 - Publishing!

Now before publishing to NPM you project needs to have a git repository so for that run this

    git init .
    git add .
    git commit -m "My awesome CLI is ready"

and after you have initialized a git repository you will need a NPM account for that sign up [here](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) after signing up run this

    npm login

after you enter your credentials you will be logged in
and finally run

    npm publish

Now your command line tool is ready! Congratulation ðŸŽ‰

## Finishing up

If you are interested in seeing the whole code check them out on my GitHub

and the package is also on NPM
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aadityasiva/n-c-c

> **Spoiler:** Yes I saved it for last it may or may not take more than 10 minutes. It took me 5 minutes to do all the steps

Bye ðŸ‘‹ and good day
