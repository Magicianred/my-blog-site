## What is GIT and why it is used

GIT is a version control system which tracks your files for changes and when it finds changes it saves it in a hidden folder and if you want to keep those changes you can stage these changes and finally commit the changes with a message describing the changes to the main repository or if you want to discard these changes. **Why It is used** This kind of system is really useful when you are collaborating with your team.

So yeah I am ending this small introductory post here stay tuned for the upcoming posts in this series.
