Okay so now I think that you know what is GIT and why it is used **if you don't know I recommend reading my previous post**

## Installing

### For Windows:

First head over to https://git-scm.com/download/win/ this will start the download of the latest version of GIT. After the file is downloaded follow these steps.

#### Step 1

 ‚òù Locate and open this file after download

#### Step 2


Agree to the license after reading it

#### Step 3


Choose the **Let GIT decide** Option

#### Step 4

Now press next and continue with the installer and your good to go.

### For Linux

For Linux there are different methods for different distributions so head over to https://git-scm.com/download/linux/ and do the steps given there for your distro of Linux.

### For macOS

#### Step 1

Install homebrew from here https://brew.sh/

#### Step 2

run this

    brew install git

## Testing the installation

To test if it is installed properly run this

If it is printing the version then **Congrats !!üéâüéäü•≥** it is installed successfully.
